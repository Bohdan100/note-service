# Note-service Application
The **Note-service** is a Spring Boot application that offers a secure and  intuitive digital notepad for managing personal notes. Each user has their own dedicated notebook(s), where they can easily add, update, view, and delete their notes. Notes can be searched by title or content, and deleted based on keywords in the title. Each note consists of a title and content. Users access the application using their email and password, and can register with their name, email, and password.

## Features
- Authentication and registration via email and password.
- Add, update, view, and delete notes.
- Search notes by title or content.
- Delete notes based on keywords in the title.
- Each user has a personalized notebook.
- Persist note data using MySQL.
- Handle database migrations with Flyway.
- Simplify setup and build processes with Gradle.
- Streamline code using Lombok to reduce boilerplate.
- Ensure code quality and correctness with JUnit 5 and Mockito tests.

## Requirements
The application is built using the following technologies:
- **Spring Boot**: 3.3.5
- **Java Platform (JDK)**: 21
- **MySQL**: 8.0.40
- **Flyway**: 11.0.1
- **Thymeleaf**: 3.4.1
- **Lombok**: 1.18.36
- **JUnit**: 5
- **Mockito**: 5
- **Gradle**: 8.8
  
## Database Setup
Before running the application, follow these steps to set up the database:

1. **Create a MySQL 8.0.40 Database**  
   Set up a MySQL database to store the applicationâ€™s data.

2. **Configure Database and User**  
   Perform the following steps in your MySQL instance to create a user and database for the application:

    1. Create a new user with a password:
       ```sql
       CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'admin2'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret1234';
       ```

    2. Create a new database:
       ```sql
       CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS note;
       ```

    3. Assign ownership of the database to the new user:
       ```sql
       GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON note.* TO 'admin2'@'%';
       GRANT SUPER ON *.* TO 'admin2'@'%';
       ```

3. **Connect to the Database**  
   To connect to the `note` database as the `admin2` user, use the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   mysql -u admin2 -p -D note

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bohdan100/note-service
   cd note-service

2. Build and Run the Application Using Gradle in Terminal:
   ```bash
   .\gradlew bootRun     (for Windows)
   ./gradlew bootRun     (for Linux)
    ```
3. Build and Run the Application Using a JAR File:
   ```bash
   .\gradlew bootJar     (for Windows)
   ./gradlew bootJar     (for Linux)
   
   java -jar note-service.jar
    ```
4. Access the Application in Your Browser:
   - **Register**: [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register)
   - **Login**: [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login)

   - **Notes**:
       - Get list: [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/note/list](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/note/list)
       - Add: [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/note/add](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/note/add)
       - Update: [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/note/edit/{id}](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/note/edit/{id})
       - Search: [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/note/searchTitleAndContent?query={text}](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/note/searchTitleAndContent?query={text})
5. Testing the application:
   ```bash
   .\gradlew runAllTests     (for Windows)
   ./gradlew runAllTests     (for Linux)

   .\gradlew test            (for Windows)
   ./gradlew test            (for Linux)
   ```
   
6. Testing the Application on GitHub:
   - create a `.github/workflows` directory in your project
   - add a file named `gradle-test.yml` to define your workflow.
   - set up an action to trigger on commit/push by configuring the file as follows:
     ```yaml
       on:
         push:
           branches: [ "master" ]
         pull_request:
           branches: [ "master" ]
       ```
   - define a testing task in the workflow file, for example:
       ```yaml
       name: Run all tests
       run: ./gradlew runAllTests
       ```
   - after each commit, check the test results in the **Actions** section of your GitHub repository.
